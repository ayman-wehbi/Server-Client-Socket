# Server-Client-Socket

### This is a multithreaded socket chat program created given a simple MyServer/MyClient file as an example to learn the structure of s server and a client. My task was to figure out how to implement a multithreaded server that takes multiple clients through a client handler file. This was all accomplished by using a socket, a server socket, a buffered reader and writer, and strings to intake usernames. I used an ArrayList to store the clients since its linear and very easy to iterate through.
